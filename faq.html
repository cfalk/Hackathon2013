<div class="contentHeader">What is the Tri-Co Hackathon?</div>
<p>
A marathon 48-hour event in which student teams from Bryn Mawr, Haverford, and Swarthmore Colleges create apps, products, devices and whatever other cool, zany things they dream up. 
</p>

<div class="contentHeader">Who can participate?</div>
<p>
Any and all current Tri-Co students are invited and encouraged to participate. It doesnt matter how technical you are, your major, or whether you've done a hackathon before. This is an opportunity to learn new skills, get creative, make connections, and do something awesome in a weekend.
</p>

<div class="contentHeader">How do I sign up?</div>
<p>
Fill out the sign-up form by Thursday, January 23, 2014. You can sign up as part of a team of up to five people or as an individual.
</p>

<div class="contentHeader">What can I build in the hackathon?</div>
<p>
Anything, really, though our focus is on web and mobile technology. We encourage teams to come up with cool, clever projects that incorporate a miriad of perspectives and ideas. 
</p>

<div class="contentHeader">What if I dont know how to write code?</div>
<p>
Dont sweat it too much. All kinds of creative thinking goes into making an app or product, from the concept to the design to communicating the value of it. If youre a beginner in tech and want to learn some useful skills, we recommend you come to the boot camp on Friday in Hilles 109. Different presenters will talk about programming concepts, skills, and tools that will help you in the hackathon and beyond.
</p>

<div class="contentHeader">Will there be food?</div>
<p>
There will absolutely be food (and coffee, of course) provided to participants throughout the weekend.
</p>

<div class="contentHeader">Do I need to sleep?</div>
<p>
Its a 48-hour event, so we certainly recommend sleeping during parts of it. Founders Great Hall will remain open the whole time, so you can choose when to work and when to sleep.
</p>

<div class="contentHeader">If I'm a Bryn Mawr or Swarthmore student, can I stay at Haverford over the weekend?</div>
<p>
We're working on this. If you would like accommodations on campus during the weekend, please email <a href="mailto:dburgerlen@haverford.edu">dburgerlen@haverford.edu</a>. Better yet, if you have a friend at Haverford who might let you crash in his or her dorm room, talk to them.
