<p>
Calling all computer scientists, artists, gamers, inventors, tinkerers, and humanists of all stripes! Got an idea for a web app, a new product, or just looking for an excuse to build something awesome in 48 hours?
</p>
<p>
Announcing the Tri-Co Hackathon 2014 on the weekend of January 24-26, 2014 in Founders Great Hall at Haverford. We'll begin at 5:30 p.m. on Friday and run all the way through 5:30 p.m. on Sunday, after which teams will present their projects to a panel of guest judges, who will choose an overall winner as well as winners in various sub-categories. There will be pizza, snacks, plenty of coffee (of course), and other food throughout.
</p>
<p>
The event is open to any and all current Tri-Co students (tell your friends!), regardless of your technical skills, your major, or whether you've participated in a hackathon before. If you're interested, please fill out the sign-up form by noon on Thursday, January 23. You can sign up as an individual or as part of a team of up to six people. If you sign up as an individual, we'll place you on a team.
</p>
<p>
It's going to be a blast. We hope you'll all sign up! If you have any questions, feel free to contact.
