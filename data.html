<div class="contentHeader">Data and Challenges</div>
<p>
Want to participate in the hackathon but dont have an idea of something to build? No prob, Bob. We've come up with some ideas and challenges for you using data from the Tri-Co. Feel free to pursue any idea you'd like though! You are not limited to the challenges or data listed here.
</p>

<div class="contentHeader">Potential Challenges</div>
<ul>
 <li>An online game incorporating materials from the collections of the Tri-Co.</li>
 <li>A mashup generator of archival text, image, video, and sound from our collections.</li>
 <li>A dashboard of library usage statistics that we can run monthly to see how our collections are being used.</li>
 <li>A way to make locating relevant materials and sources for a research project easier.</li>
</ul>

<div class="contentHeader">Potential Data</div>
<p>
For each of the following data sources, well provide a fact sheet including the data content, types of data, how to access the data, and links to related stuff.
</p>
<ul>
 <li>A (giant) CSV file containing a record for each book within the circulating collections at the three colleges. Each record will indicate how many times it has circulated since 1990, how many times it circulated this year, and all of the bibliographic data as well as the location of the book itself, subject headings, etc. Well also include links to APIs from national-level cultural organizations and/or full text providers (Project Gutenberg, Internet Archive, etc.).</li>
 <li>A CSV file containing records for every DVD in our collection and links to the associated national level APIs about film.</li>
 <li>An API for <a href="http://triceratops.brynmawr.edu">Dspace</a> and a list of the collections that are accessible there. These include:</li>
 <ul>
  <li>74 videos from the Swarthmore College Archives
  <li>Haverford College senior theses (e.g., 789 Political Science theses dating back to 1965)
  <li>222 Honor Council abstracts from Haverford, dating back to 1984
 </ul>
 <li>An API for Content DM and a list of collections that are accessible there. Interesting collections Include:
 <ul>
  <li>Bryn Mawr Colleges historic maps collection
  <li>There are many, many, many collections of archival college photos, records, newspapers, letters, etc., listed <a href="http://triptych.brynmawr.edu/cdm/">here</a>.
 </ul>
 <li>A list of the various social media presences of our institutions and the APIs for those sites.
 <li>A collection of common APIs in the library and cultural heritage world.
</ul>
