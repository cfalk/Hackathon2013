<div class="contentHeader">Rules</div>
<div class="contentSubHeader">Participation</div>
<p>
Participants must be current students at Bryn Mawr, Haverford, or Swarthmore Colleges. Participation is closed to immediate family of judges or anyone actively employed by a sponsoring company at the time of the competition.
</p>

<div class="contentSubHeader">Teams</div>
<p>
Teams may consist of two to five people. Each team must submit a list of members by 5:30 p.m. on Friday, January 24<span class="superscript">th</span>. Teams can be composed of students from any or all of the three Tri-Co schools.
</p>

<div class="contentSubHeader">Prior to the Event</div>
<p>
Ideas may be brainstormed before the start time, but no implementation work may be done ahead of time. This includes coding and graphic design. Teams may, however, practice using any APIs, frameworks, or data sources necessary so long as none of the code involved is used in the submitted project.
</p>

<div class="contentSubHeader">The Event Itself</div>
<p>
Participants are free to seek help from any available resources during the hackathon, including online tutorials, on-site support staff, and members of other teams, so long as the work to be submitted is done entirely by members of that team. Teams are able to utilize third-party programs, libraries, CMSs, etc. as they see fit.
</p>
<p>
Teams can schedule their own work time during the 48-hour competition period. All work, including presentation preparation, must stop at 5:30 p.m. on Sunday, January 26, when teams will submit their entries to the judges.
</p>

<div class="contentSubHeader">After the Event</div>
<p>
By submitting a project, you and your team grant the Tri-Co Hackathon organizers the unrestricted right to use your submission material, at no cost, for promotional purposes of future Tri-Co Hackathon events.
